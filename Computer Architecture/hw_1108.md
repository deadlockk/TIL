1. For each code sequence below, state whether it must stall, can avoid stalls using only
forwarding, or can execute without stalling or forwarding 

sequence 1

    lw $t0, 0 ($t0)
    add $t1, $t0, $t0  

sequence 2

    add $t1, $t0, $t0
    addi $t2, $t0, 5

sequence 3

    addi $t1, $t0, 1
    addi $t2, $t0, 2
    addi $t3, $t0, 3
    addi $t4, $t0, 4
    addi $t5, $t0, 5

Sol)

 **sequence 1: it must stall  
sequence 2: can execute without stalling or forwarding (no stalling, no forwarding)  
sequence 3: can execute without stalling or forwarding (no stalling, no forwarding)**

4. Explain pipelining and why pipelining improves the CPU performance.

Sol)

(1) Pipelining is a technique that exploits parallelism among the instructions in a sequential instruction stream. It
has the substantial advantage that, unlike programming a multiprocessor, it is fundamentally invisible to the
programmer.

(2) Pipelining improves the CPU throughput since multiple stages are operating concurrently (=in parallel,
at the same time).
