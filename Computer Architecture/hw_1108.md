1. For each code sequence below, state whether it must stall, can avoid stalls using only
forwarding, or can execute without stalling or forwarding 

sequence 1

    lw $t0, 0 ($t0)
    add $t1, $t0, $t0  

sequence 2

add $t1, $t0, $t0
addi $t2, $t0, 5

sequence 3


Sol)

 **sequence 1: it must stall  
sequence 2: can execute without stalling or forwarding (no stalling, no forwarding)  
sequence 3: can execute without stalling or forwarding (no stalling, no forwarding)**
